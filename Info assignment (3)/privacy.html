    <h2>In-Game Settings:</h2>
    
    Open the Free Fire game on your mobile device. Look for a
    "Settings" or "Options" menu. Within the settings, there might be a section
    called "Privacy" or "Legal." Check for links to the privacy policy or terms
    of service. 
   
   <h2>Official Website:</h2>
    
    Visit the official Garena Free Fire website
    using a web browser. Navigate to the "Privacy Policy" or "Terms of Service"
    section. This is usually found in the website's footer or under a dedicated
    legal section. 
    
   <h2> Mobile App Store: </h2>
    On the app store (Google Play Store for
    Android or Apple App Store for iOS), you may find a link to the privacy
    policy on the Free Fire app page.
     
    <h2>Contact Support:</h2>
      If you have trouble finding the privacy policy, you can contact Free Fire support for
    assistance. There might be a customer support section within the game or on
    the official website where you can submit queries.
